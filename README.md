## Assignment Overview
This repository contains the practical assignment solutions for the OOPS course. The codebase is structured into multiple modules, each covering different concepts of C++ programming.

### Directory Structure
The assignment is organized as follows:
- **Module 1**: C++ BASICS.
- **Module 2**: Classes and Data Abstraction.
- **Module 3**: Inheritance, Virtual Functions & Polymorphism.
- **Module 4**: C++ and I/O.
- **Module 5**: Exception Handling.


## How to Run
The programs are written in C++. You can compile and run them using `g++`.

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler (MinGW for Windows)
- VScode (or any text editor)


## Naming Convention
Files are named in the format: `mod_number_prog_number.cpp`  
Example: `mod_01_prog_01.cpp`

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the specific module directory.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ mod_01_prog_01.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
   (On Windows: `output.exe`)

## Coding Standards
- Meaningful variable names
- Correct indentation
- Comments included where required
